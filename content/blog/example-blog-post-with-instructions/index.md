Welcome to the Common Nonsense Blog! This article serves to document the capabilities of this blog and show examples of the tools that are available to you. 

# Important Instructions

The editing interface is not as forgiving as something like Google docs. Therefore, if you are going to be writing a blog post, **I strongly recommend that you draft it up in a text editor, and then copy it over to this editor and apply the formatting that you want.** 

When you create a new blog post, it defaults to being a **draft**. If the post is ready and you want it to be published on the website, flip the switch to take the post out of draft mode. 

Clicking the "Publish" button in the top left doesn't actually publish the article if the "Draft" switch is still on, but it will save it so you can come back to it later or so someone else who has access can view and edit it. If you leave the page without clicking "Publish," your changes will be lost.

The Publish Date will automatically be set to the date that the blog post was created. If you set the publish date to a date in the future, the blog post will not be published until that date. The site is currently not configured to rebuild automatically, so the post will not be visible until after the publish date and after a build is triggered. 

It can take a bit of time for the article to show up on the website. It will take more time if you are uploading images as well. However if everything is working correctly, the website should update within 1-2 minutes for the average blog post. 

If your blog post is not showing up on the site, check the following:

1. Is the "Draft" switch set to off? 
2. Is the "Publish Date" set to today or earlier?
3. Did you click the "Publish" button in the top left? 

# Basic text features

The text above is a heading, more specifically an h1. There are six levels of headings, but headings 2-6 all look the same on this website.

## Heading 2

**This text is bold.** 

*This text is italicized.*

[This is a link.](#)

* This is a bulleted list

And then: 

1. This is a numbered list
2. etc.

# Media

This blog supports images:

It's a good idea to provide a descriptive alt text to improve SEO and accessibility. 

## Featured Images

Every blog post will have a featured image. The image that is featured will be the first of the following that exists:

1. An image that is in the blog post whose file name matches the "Featured Image" field at the top of the post. You can edit the "Featured Image" field to choose which image you want to feature. 
2. If there is nothing in the "Featured Image" field, a random image from the blog post will be chosen. 
3. If the blog post contains no images, there is a default image that will be used instead.

To Demonstrate, I will feature this image:

You can embed a YouTube video by copying the embed code and pasting it inline like this: 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eQAa0GihLGU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To do this, go to the video's page, click "share", click "embed", click "copy" and then paste the code like you see above.
